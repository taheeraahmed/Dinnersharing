# Dinnersharing
A norwegian website created by using the Django framework. Here we were supposed to handle a client who wanted a website which could invite people over for dinner (also strangers). It's almost like Tise, just with dinner.

This is the result after taking a course TDT4140 which is about agile software development. 

Different "specs":
